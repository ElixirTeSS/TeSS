    NOTE: This API is no longer kept up-to-date with changes to the TeSS data model. Please use the alternate JSON-API instead.
    Access, search and filter through collections of training materials, events, packages, and workflows in TeSS.
    As a rule of thumb - You can add .json to the end of most pages to retrieve the data in a common exchange format. e.g
    - https://tess.elixir-europe.org/events/software-carpentry-west-virginia-university.json
    - https://tess.elixir-europe.org/materials/rna-seq-de-novo-transcriptome-reconstruction-with-rna-seq.json

        This operation does not permit any parameters except the name as part of the URL. the name is a _slug_ of the title (lowercase + hyphenated).

        The base url (materials.json) returns the first page of materials as seen on the UI (if you just go to /materials). To navigate through and filter out; use the below parameters. The returned value is an array of JSON objects. These parameters in JSON are formed exactly the same as within the UI so it is worth experimenting by clicking filters in the website and changing /materials to /materials.json to see how to create valid JSON requests.

          Combining different types of filters does a logical AND between filters, whereas combining different values from the same kind of filter does a logical OR between values.

          For example (scientific topic is 'Bioinformatics' OR 'Data visualisation') AND (target_audience is 'Life Science Researchers' OR 'PHD Students').
