        <p>
          TeSS is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elixir-europe.org/">ELIXIR's</a>
          Training e-Support System, developed by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.elixir-uk.org/">ELIXIR-UK</a>,
          for disseminating, discovering and packaging training resources, primarily by aggregating information from
          ELIXIR nodes, but also from various 3rd-party content providers.
        </p>

        <p>
          New technologies are generating huge amounts of life-science data, which scientists need to
          transform into new discoveries. However, few researchers have all the right skills to take
          advantage of this sudden data bonanza.
        </p>

        <p>
          ELIXIR-UK is responding to this challenge by coordinating European initiatives to training research
          scientists in computing, statistics and bioinformatics. By plugging the skills gap,
          ELIXIR-UK aims to strengthen life sciences across Europe and set the agenda for future training needs.

                  No. TeSS is an aggregator of ELIXIR-relevant training information and resources, harvested
                  from individual ELIXIR nodes and from 3rd-party content providers.

                  TeSS harvests training information from ELIXIR nodes and from 3rd-party content providers,
                  and aggregates that information according to different ‘views’ (e.g., ELIXIR overview versus
                  node-specific) -
                  it does not store the training materials themselves (it is not a repository).

                <p>
                  The GOBLET Training Portal acts a repository of materials and courses, and provides a catalogue of
                  trainers
                  and course organisers. The primary focus of TeSS is on ELIXIR resources and nodes; the principal focus

                  If you wish your content to be added to TeSS, please contact the TeSS team so that we can arrange to
                  harvest

                  the 'Add training
                  material' button. In the multi-step form provided, simply complete the various fields, add a
                  link to the relevant resources and, where appropriate, attribute the content to a particular provider.
                  By doing this, you effectively create what is termed a ‘training material’ in TeSS; this does not
                  contain the actual material,
                  but links to it on the content provider’s website or portal.

                  Alternatively, as mentioned above, training material and related information and metadata can be
                  ingested automatically using a content provider's API (if such exists), or by contacting the TeSS
                  development team to develop a suitable scraper.

                  Training packages in TeSS are bespoke collections of ‘training materials’. For example, you can create

                  you need to create a link from the relevant training material to that package (note:
                  training materials can belong to several training packages or workflows). To do this, navigate to

                  from the drop-down list. This effectively adds the ‘training material’ to the selected package.

                  through specific types of data analysis (e.g., protein sequence analysis, protein structure analysis,
                  homology modelling, MS-based metabolomic analysis …), highlighting relevant tutorials, lessons,
                  software tools, databases, and so on, relevant to each step of the analysis pipeline.
                  From the available resources, users may select those of particular interest and assemble them into
