          "description": "<p>Work and employment are vital to post-university life. Existing sociological studies highlight the complex issues young university graduates face when transitioning from university to work. In recent years, the Romanian labour market has been home to many outsourcing jobs, and there is a high rate of young university graduates employed in the business service sector. However, numerous young graduates experience overeducation, as their education and skills are mismatched, considering the required skills and abilities of available job opportunities in the service sector. A parallel and neglected concern is the rise of misunderstanding of concepts such as employability, skills, and decent or precarious work, thus aggravating sceptics among numerous employers regarding young graduates' work readiness and their inadequacy in responding effectively to the rapidly changing labour market needs. This study sheds light on what is happening at the intersection of university education and work. Drawing from a two-year ethnographic case study with reflective thematic analysis, we analyse young university graduates' experiences in non-graduate positions and demystify knowledge-based economy vocabularies, mostly graduate employability and skills. The results highlight graduate employability as a complex and confusing concept, sometimes described as skill, employment, and work readiness. Employability and skills are extensively described based on micro (individual)-level characteristics and less on macro (labour market supply and demand) characteristics. The findings also argue that entry-level employees' experiences of education-job mismatch as they embark on non-graduate jobs involving their knowledge and skills underutilisation. Alongside the devaluation of university credentials, employers purposively ignore the hard skills young graduates possess, and their working conditions entail deskilling and hinder employees' autonomy in work planning and task execution. The results are potentially helpful, as they illustrate the need to widen the scope of understanding knowledge-based economy vocabularies. They can inform key actors in reconsidering employability, skills, and decent work beyond the current dominant perspectives in an uncertain graduate world of work.<br><br>The concept of employability has different meanings, depending on the vocabulary, context, and specific vocabulary used. Our research participants described and understood the concept of employability and its relation to vocabulary: Employability as a general concept refers to a person's ability to gain and maintain employment. It encompasses a range of skills, knowledge, &nbsp;and attributes that make an individual desirable to employers. This includes technical skills, soft skills, educational qualifications, work experience, and personal qualities. The vocabulary used to describe employability focused on terms related to job skills, qualifications, industry-specific knowledge, and personal attributes valued in the job market. Employability can be understood in the context of education and training. This refers to how education and training programs prepare individuals for the job market and equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in their chosen careers. In this context, the vocabulary used to discuss employability includes terms related to curriculum design, learning outcomes, skill development, vocational training, and career guidance. Employability can also be relevant for individuals interested in starting their businesses or working as self-employed professionals. The vocabulary used to<br>discuss employability in entrepreneurship may include terms related to business planning, marketing, financial management, innovation, risk-taking, and self-motivation. Employability can also be understood concerning specific industries and sectors. Different industries may have their own vocabulary and employability requirements. For example, employability in the technology sector may focus on programming languages, software development methodologies, and technical certifications.<br><br>In contrast, employability in the healthcare sector may focus on medical terminology, patient care skills, and regulatory knowledge. The vocabulary used in these contexts may be specific to the industry or sector and include technical terms, industry jargon, and specialised expertise. Overall, the relationship between vocabulary and description of employability lies in how different terms and languages are used to highlight other aspects of employability in various contexts. The specific terminology used can provide insights into the skills, knowledge, qualifications, and personal attributes valued in different industries, educational settings, job markets, and entrepreneurial endeavours.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Semantics, i.e. terms and their meaning, can be shared, agreed upon, and used in data to make such data more FAIR, especially in terms of interoperability and reusability. The currently most often used technology for machine-actionable vocabularies of semantic terms are RDF-based ontologies (RDF = the W3C Resource Description Framework). But while the RDF has been around for about 20 years, there is still no broadly known tooling for using ontology terms during routine data entry and design.<br><br>To address this problem, we are implementing a data development framework that builds on semantic vocabularies as one of its core elements. This framework will provide a graphical interface where users can build their data (structures) in the form of knowledge graphs, i.e. nodes and edges that correspond to semantic vocabulary terms plus \"raw values\" (e.g. strings or numbers). This graph data editor will also support tables and forms as more compact graph elements for entity and attribute lists respectively.<br><br>In the editor, users will also get development support much like in IDEs (integrated development environments) for programming languages, e.g. by showing vocabulary term annotations on hover, auto-completing graph elements expected with specific terms, or suggesting existing terms and data structures when users are creating their own.<br><br>These support features together with the graph data editor will be embedded in the before mentioned data development framework. Within this framework an organization can choose desired ID services (e.g. ORCID, DOI, or in-house databases), set common vocabularies (e.g. QUDT [1] for units or BFO [2] as a top-level ontology), and have a central knowledge graph that all members can contribute to. (Groups of) users will be able to build their own graph data sets using git+GitLab for provenance and project management together with the organization's ID services and vocabularies.<br><br><strong>Acknowledgements</strong><br>This work is being done as part of the Helmholtz Metadata Collaborations efforts to improve the<br>metadata management in the German Helmholtz Association of Research Centers.<br><br><strong>References</strong><br>1.

          "description": "<p>Ontologies and semantic artefacts are crucial for the representation and annotation of data in a standardized manner, aligning with the FAIR Data Principles. With the proliferation of ontologies and semantic artefacts in various domains, the need for common platforms to host, serve, align, and reuse these resources has become essential. The OntoPortal Alliance (https://ontoportal.org), a consortium of research and infrastructure teams, has developed and maintained multiple ontology repositories and semantic artifact catalogs, including BioPortal, AgroPortal, EcoPortal, MatPortal, and more. These repositories serve different scientific disciplines and are built on the open-source OntoPortal technology [1]. The presentation will present the OntoPortal technology as a generic resource to build ontology repositories and semantic artefact catalogues that can support resources ranging from SKOS thesauri to OBO, RDF-S, and OWL ontologies. The presentation will outline the set of services of OntoPortal, including its standard/default features such as ontology hosting, grouping, versioning, and search, ontology browsing, mappings, community feedback, ontology-based annotation, and ontology recommendation. As well as additional features and services developed by the Alliance, including enhanced mapping features and semantic annotation workflow, extended ontology metadata, ontology FAIRness assessment, and support for SKOS resources. We will illustrate with various running installations of the OntoPortal technology. A specific example on how the O'FAIRe (Ontology FAIRness Evaluator) [2] methodology helps to automatically assess to which level a semantic artefact or ontology respects the FAIR Principles will be illustrated with AgroPortal (https://agroportal.lirmm.fr). The OntoPortal Alliance's open-source project organization provides the essentials for a community or a project to start/maintain a semantic artefact catalogue. It also emphasizes the importance of community participation. The OntoPortal code is available on GitHub, and the Alliance encourages collaboration and contributions.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p><p>This work has been supported by the D2KAB project (ANR-18-CE23-0017), the French NUMEV-IRT OntoPortal Alliance (ANR-10-LABX-20), the Horizon Europe FAIR-IMPACT project (grant #101057344).

          "description": "<p>The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a \"second wave\" of research into ontologies. A pivotal aspect of this revival is the ability of LLMs to enhance the recognition of named entities (and relations), facilitating the construction of knowledge graphs and linking to ontological frameworks. Crucially, ontologies enable fact verification on LLM outputs through advanced reasoning.</p><p>While the \"first wave\" was driven mainly by academic interest, the combination of ontologies with LLMs has profound implications in industrial applications. In an industrial context, standardisation can result both in the opening of opportunities as well as the exclusion of competing solutions. The interest from industrial corporations in the standardisation of ontologies raises questions about access to markets since the necessity to adhere to specific data models could result in barriers to entry.</p><p>An interesting historical perspective is the adoption of ontologies and open data in spatial data and in earth and environmental research. Here, the need for organising complex information about environmental data and sharing these spatial data was a driver for government agencies to invest in the development of ontologies such as the Global Change Master Directory and standardised encodings for spatial data. At the same time, the rise of the mobile web and the adoption of Global Navigation Systems brought new opportunities for web applications with a location component. Technical simplifications resulted in a breakthrough for spatial data applications. This example shows how open standards can open new opportunities.</p><p>In this presentation, we want to explore the interplay between LLMs and ontologies, the importance of open standards and the development of open domain and application ontologies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the teams in the UWA Centre for Semantic Technologies (a new Centre emerging from the UWA NLP-TLP group) and Theme 1 in the ARC Centre for Transforming Maintenance through Data Science</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p>1.

          "description": "<p>In November 2022, a small group of colleagues with expertise and interest in vocabularies -their development, management, support and use - came together in Canberra, Australia to explore how the ecosystem of vocabularies in Australia could be made more sustainable and broadly used. This working group has met on a regular basis since that foundation workshop, with the aim of establishing a roadmap for the future of vocabularies in Australia and more broadly.</p><p>Working towards a vision that, within the next 5-10 years the utility of vocabularies is well understood within Australia and there to be a burgeoning ecosystem of vocabularies and associated services that lower the barriers of using vocabularies as a key foundation of data assets, services and infrastructure across the research, government and broader 'data' sector.</p><p>This paper lays out a shared view of what a future vocabulary ecosystem might look like, key elements of that ecosystem, and possible means for achieving that future state. It represents our thinking as a community of Australian experts in the creation, management and use of vocabularies.</p><p>This session will present this roadmap and have a guided discussion with the symposium participants.</p>",

          "description": "<p>The Erasmus+ Project \"Education and Training for Automation 4.0 in Thailand (ETAT)\" faced the challenge that the European Project Team was not able to speak Thai and the learners (students and lifelong-learners from companies) of the Thai partner organizations are facing challenges with the English language. Therefore, it was considered to introduce a glossary for automation engineering in the form of a collection of important terms. Out of the developed training content 671 terms the Thai partners have selected based on what they understood as important to have in the glossary and subsequently they translated those terms into Thai.</p><p>The ETAT Team led discussions about the semantic towards the close context with the teaching material. Already at mid-term of the ETAT project the glossary was completed. However, so far - there is no meaningful feedback from the potential users, because the first testing was in the try-out of the training material with students from the Thai organisations. It is expected that in the lifelong-leaning process this glossary will become valuable for Thai learners due to the fact that professionals from industries often lack English language skills.</p><p>In general, this glossary should be seen as an open-source tool. In technical terms the glossary was implemented based on available free glossary software - following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reproduceable) principles. The glossary is accessible from both sides - the ETAT project website (https://etat-erasmus.com) and the individual training modules. It is understood that the glossary accommodates the basic terms necessary for automation engineering trainings. Due to the universal content of automation engineering, it can be translated in the different languages, wherever automation engineering is lectured.</p><p>Since the ETAT project training material is available under the creative common licence, the use of the glossary can be harmonized with the freely teaching material.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p><p>The project work is supported by the ERASMUS+ programm with the Grant Agreement 610154-EPP-1-2019-1-DE-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p>1.

The approach takes a modular approach with tools to support composition to match reused schema elements to reusable JSON-LD contexts, allowing implementations to simplify profiling by adding additional constraints, such as vocabulary usage, to specific sub-elements of an overall application schema. The approach uses open source tools based on the \"OGC Building Blocks\" model - part of the full-spectrum interoperability resource now known as the OGC Rainbow.<br><br><strong>Acknowledgements</strong><br>The Institute of Research is supported by the Australian Government through the National<br>Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, NCRIS.<br><br><strong>References</strong><br>1.

          "description": "<p>The Language Data Commons of Australia project has developed a metadata vocabulary based on the previous work of the Open Language Archive Community (OLAC) [1]. The primary documentation of this vocabulary is located in a github repository (https://github.com/Language-Research-Technology/language-data-commons-vocabs), but this is not an ideal form for providing information to users. Firstly, github may be seen as an intimidating venue by less technically-minded users. Secondly, the presentation there is (necessarily) formal and technical which is also a barrier for some users<br><br>We have therefore decided to create a more accessible account of the vocabulary. We are using the GitBook platform to do this (Metadata for Language Data - Metadata for Language Data (gitbook.io)) which provides a more familiar format for non-specialists. This approach also allows us to provide explanations of key concepts and recommendations for the usage of vocabulary items. Our aim is to create a resource which is a stand-alone source on good metadata practice for language data and also a suitable target for links from our portal and help pages which gives users useful and accessible information.<br><br><strong>Acknowledgements</strong><br>The Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA) project received investment ([https://doi.org/10.47486/HIR001](https://doi.org/10.47486/HIR001)) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC).

          "description": "<p>The Australian Urban Research Infrastructure Network (AURIN) has garnered over 13 years of experience in pioneering digital research infrastructure to empower cutting-edge urban and social research. In the face of escalating challenges posed by climate change, energy transition, and demographic shifts, AURIN has emerged as a pivotal force in supporting Australia's response to<br>these critical issues. This strategic evolution positions AURIN as the cornerstone of Australian Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) through a range of capabilities being offered within the broader research community. The foundation of this evolution rests on the creation of a next-generation digital research infrastructure, underpinned by standardised and interoperable data and analytics delivery methods.<br><br>To elevate its suitability for UDT applications, AURIN acknowledges the necessity for substantial enhancements to its existing data and metadata storage and management practices. The proposed enhancements encompass pivotal areas such as ensuring the FAIRness of AURIN's data, the unification of shared contextual information across diverse records and dataset versions, streamlining<br>data integration through ontological frameworks, transitioning towards a centralised approach for scripting Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, and recognising the intrinsic value of machine-interpretable semantic metadata in enhancing the accessibility, findability, and interconnectedness of datasets.<br><br>In response to these challenges, AURIN is actively progressing toward the implementation of an encompassing semantic knowledge base. This knowledge base is designed to facilitate the creation, management, integration, and utilisation of AURIN data and metadata, leveraging semantic data models including controlled vocabularies and relevant ontologies. This strategic move aims to<br>enhance the interoperability of AURIN's data and empower advanced semantic-driven searches, inquiries, and analyses. The outcomes of these efforts extend to fostering sustainable and intelligent urban development. These initiatives stem from AURIN's involvement in national initiatives such as the Integrated Research Infrastructure for Social Science (IRISS) and internal research and<br>development efforts such as AURIN's UDT Testbed.<br><br><strong>Acknowledgements</strong><br>AURIN is supported by the Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).</p>",

This initiative spurred the creation of the AusGeochem platform, with the primary objective of developing and maintaining a FAIR geochemistry data ecosystem capable of hosting and interacting with diverse geochemistry and geochronology data types. AusGeochem has been designed, in partnership with Lithodat, to be used within the data collection, interpretation and pre-publication phases of research. This philosophy promotes the capture and visibility of all data generated within facilities, including data which is not published but retains scientific value to others in the community. Ultimately, it is the goal of the initiative to automate data capture where possible to facilitate upload directly from machines or processing software, to reduce human induced error and maximise data collection.<br><br>For effective automated data sharing between institutions, researchers, and machines/processing software, thus improving the value and reusability of data. The AGN has produced a number of best practice data reporting schema and vocabularies for a variety of data types through consultation with expert advisory groups and, where available, following published community recommendations. Adherence to a logical, published vocabulary and schema is essential for data interoperability. Reporting templates for U-Pb, fission track, (U-Th-Sm)/He, Ar-Ar and major and trace geochemistry data, as well as for ICP-MS analytical methodology have now been established and will soon be discoverable through the Research Vocabularies Australia service. Vocabularies are available for the community to use directly or develop cross-walks for integration with other services, including government geological surveys and international repositories such as EarthChem, GEOROC and AstroMaterials, who are current collaborators through the international OneGeochemistry project.<br><br><strong>Acknowledgements</strong><br>The AuScope Geochemistry Network is supported by the Australian Government through the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy, NCRIS.</p>",

          "description": "<p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>The secondary use of information obtained from medical records is witnessing a significant increase worldwide, particularly in Australia. This growing practice has the potential to reveal intricate relationships between individuals, medical conditions, and pharmaceutical interventions. Its widespread adoption is fueled by the development and implementation of common data models, along with technologies such as pseudonymisation and data linkage, which offer a balance between data privacy and usability.</p><p>A significant impediment to widespread adoption is that a considerable proportion of terms in Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems are not systematically mapped to standard medical vocabularies such as SNOMED CT or ICD-11. Consequently, there is an essential need to translate coded and free text into these standardized medical vocabularies both accurately and efficiently. Additionally, there is a growing demand to share these mapping data between various research groups, as this collaborative effort could potentially expedite the adoption process.</p><p>In alignment with this need, an extension of the Research Vocabularies Australia (RVA) service at the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) is being developed. This enhancement aims to foster the application of standard health terminologies and mappings within the Australian research community, thereby promoting data interoperability for both research and health service partners. The ARDC are working with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) leveraging existing national tools and capabilities, namely Ontoserver (curates the provision of SNOMED-CT AU and mappings to it) and Snap to Snomed (helps implement new mappings to Snomed), to build a secure platform for this important service. The Australian Health Research Alliance (AHRA) is supporting the delivery of this capability across our national community via the AHRA Transformational Data Collaboratiion (AHRA TDC) led by The University of Melbourne. The Australian Health Research Alliance represents over 90% of researchers and 86% of acute hralthcare services across Australia</p><p><strong>Methods</strong></p><p>In order for this service to truly deliver value, it was crucial to engage with the community. To this end, we organized a workshop at Melbourne Connect at the University of Melbourne, complemented by an online component to broaden accessibility. Our invitation list was extensive and diverse, encompassing a wide range of stakeholders from the healthcare sector, government agencies, and research institutions. The use of communications pathways via the Australian Health Research Alliance greatly facilitated the broad recruitment.&nbsp;</p><p>The valuable insights derived from this workshop led to the formation of the Research Terminologies Australia Advisory Panel. This body was constituted with the express purpose of ensuring our service consistently aligns with the evolving needs of users and effectively achieves its projected goals. Additionally, the panel plays a crucial role in influencing both the architectural and functional design aspects of the new service.</p><p>Our initial objective was to set up a version of Snap to Snomed at the ARDC, providing a solid foundation for our service. The secondary goal was to enhance the functionality beyond mapping to Snomed CT to allow mappings between any vocabularies. The initial use-case will be mapping free text and codes to the RxNorm drug vocabulary rather than mapping to SNOMED-CT.</p><p><strong>Results</strong></p><p>We have thoroughly outlined the crucial business requirements and constructed an in-depth functional specification for our new service. Snap to Snomed (now called SnapAGoGo) has been seamlessly installed and is currently fully operational at the ARDC. This setup allows users to utilize their existing Australian institutional credentials for secure login to the service via the Australian Access Federation. Moreover, we have broadened the service's scope by integrating support for mapping to RxNorm, marking a significant enhancement in its functionality.</p><p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p><p>The new service will function as an indispensable tool in the generation and preservation of mappings, translating free-text data into established terminologies, with an initial emphasis on the Snomed CT and RxNorm vocabularies. Our future vision for this service is to establish it as the foremost destination for mapping, serving as a trusted repository of information that guides users in selecting the most appropriate vocabularies for a wide array of use cases.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong>.</p><p>Funding was provided to this project by the ARDC</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

          "description": "<p>A research project (Kneebone &amp; Robinson, 2022) that constructs new biosecurity research vocabularies as part of a broader digital library initiative will be discussed. The biosecurity domain will be introduced with reference to key research and policy institutions and organising frameworks. Vocabulary construction and integration within graph database and search applications will be outlined, within the context of broader project metadata pipelines (Kneebone, 2022).<br><br>Warrant for new biosecurity vocabularies and constituent concepts will be explained. The inputs for biosecurity vocabularies are survey data, logic models, existing glossaries and classifications, and the results of corpus linguistic analysis. The approach to new vocabulary construction and implementation is contextualised with reference to known biosecurity problems and the associated questions that inform the scope and breadth of vocabulary reference structures.<br><br>A number of concept schemes and custom ontologies have been developed to support automated indexing and user search tasks, including the Biosecurity Thesaurus (Centre of Excellence for Biosecurity Risk Analysis, 2022). These efforts, as well as challenges presented by vocabulary construction, including sourcing inputs, developing frameworks and aligning concept schemes with application profiles are discussed. Linguistic corpus methods and tools used to augment vocabulary development will be discussed also.<br><br><strong>Acknowledgements</strong><br>Centre of Excellence for Biosecurity Risk Analysis is supported by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry under Australian Government grant award GA198901-V1.<br><br><strong>References</strong><br>1.

While this is an appealing idea, it is not a simple matter to make it work in practical terms. Metadata is a critical ingredient in FAIR implementation, especially to support the machine-actionability which is central to the FAIR vision: metadata must be more complete, more detailed, and there must be more of it. Controlled vocabularies are a critical component, yet they remain far too inaccessible. This talk will characterise the metadata landscape and the challenges we face regarding FAIR controlled vocabularies: Why, when the technology and standards can easily solve the problem, do we remain unable to leverage these critical assets? In trying to answer these questions, we can begin see the directions we must take to realize the promise of FAIR, and fulfill the central role controlled vocabularies must play for us to do so.</p>",

          "description": "<p>Delivery of integrated primary health care across Australia is being prevented by lack of interoperability of healthcare systems due to the data is structured in centralised databases to suit a single enterprise application, impacting health information access and quality of care for patients, and the sustainability of primary health care. In this presentation we will provide an update to the health ontology and vocabulary extensions that are being developed under a project that the Australian National University's Software Innovation Institute (SII) is undertaking in collaboration with Gurriny Yealamucka Health Service (Gurriny) in the Yarrabah Indigenous community of North Queensland, Australia. The aim of this project is to build a first-of-a-kind privacy-focused digital health platform for personal data storage to guarantee that individuals will have ownership and control over their own health data.&nbsp;<br><br>The proposed framework is using Social Linked Data (Solid) technology [1], a decentralised data storage specification for software application development, using open standards mostly developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), including the Semantic Web technology stack. Using Solid individuals can securely collect, control, store, and manage their own personal data in an online storage space called a personal online datastore (POD). Solid PODs also allow granular control of data sharing using data access control policies to provision a trust-no-one environment. The health data is stored as a knowledge graph using the developing health ontology.&nbsp;<br><br>SII has so far developed three prototype cross-platform software applications to provide patients in Yarrabah with the ability to record and access their own health data. These applications will also provide control over the sharing and use of that data that will shortly be co-designed and tested by patients in Yarrabah for accessing, controlling, and sharing their integrated health data.&nbsp;<br><br>References</p><p>1.

The project had international partnership, funding, and support to develop African expertise in the FAIR Management of African Data and build machine actionable data and get them to the FAIR Data Points (FDPs) that will allow data visiting by algorithms based on the access control given to the data by the data stewards (2). This presentation will describe how the VODAN Africa architecture was implemented in 88 health facilities across Africa and developed a standardised way to describe the controlled vocabularies in the different participating countries/health facilities (3) to record clinical health data on Outpatient Department (OPD), Anti-Natal Care and COVID-19 reported cases as well as research data collected on the incidence of COVID-19. The human- and machine-readable data objects are produced in a distributed architecture of locally governed, linked, human- and machine-readable data that supports analytics at the point of care and—through data visiting, across facilities—for generic analytics.<br><br>References<br>1.

Not only do researchers increasingly rely on software for their work, but many are involved in the creation, development, and maintenance of such tools as part of their research activity and output. The visibility of research software is crucial to research effectiveness. In this report, we provide insight into infrastructure opportunities to advance the visibility of research software, based on a consultation consisting of six focus groups of stakeholders, including participants across the ARDC&rsquo;s three thematic research data commons (health and medical research, earth and environmental science research, and humanities, arts, social science and indigenous research), as well as our experience in these topics.</p>",

Highlighting 19 elements essential for RDM, 9 of which were identified for immediate action, the framework helps institutions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>design RDM policy, procedures, infrastructure and services</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>improve coordination of RDM within and between institutions.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The framework is intended specifically for Australian universities but may be useful to other research institutions. It provides an institutional-level perspective and was informed by key stakeholders across relevant business units at each university.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More information</strong><br>\nView more outputs of the <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/multi_project/australias-research-data-management-framework/\">Institutional Underpinnings program</a></p>",

To help advance this work, the ARDC, WABSI, WAMSI organised three events to explore the building of trusted environmental data and information supply chains at the University Club, University of Western Australia, Perth, 6-7 June 2023.<br>\n<br>\nThe events brought together senior representatives from large businesses and industry, senior regulators and policy leaders from the Australian and Western Australian Governments, national research institutions, research infrastructure providers and the Australian Government Department of Education.<br>\n<br>\nOver 80 stakeholders attended the events.<br>\n<br>\nThis report shares the objectives and format of the forum and workshop, and makes recommendations for next steps.<br>\n<br>\nThis activity is part of the ARDC&#39;s Planet Research Data Commons (Planet RDC), which provides national-scale data infrastructure for environmental and earth science researchers, policy makers and decision makers, and research data managers. It builds upon the ARDC&rsquo;s previous work in earth and environment-related research data infrastructure.<br>\n<br>\nThe Planet RDC brings together research, government and industry to develop systems and processes that make data more available and speed the development of analytics and models. This will help us understand the environment and address some of the most complex, interconnected and integrated challenges facing society.<br>\n<br>\nLearn more about the <a href=\"https://ardc.edu.au/planet-research-data-commons/\">Planet RDC</a>.</p>",
