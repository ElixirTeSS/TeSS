        and ZU.\n  Name of teachers: Prof. Dr. Marshall Scott Poole (University of
        Illinois) (mspoole@illinois.edu) Course objectives \n  This course will introduce
        you to the nature of theory and theory construction in the social sciences.
        The topics it will explore include the following: the nature of explanation;
        theoretical types; strategies for theory construction; the relationship between
        theory and inquiry in social science research; evaluating and critiquing theories.\n  This
        course will also introduce you to a range of theories in the social sciences,
        particularly organizational science and organizational communication studies.\u00a0
        There are so many theories in such a wide range of contexts that we cannot
        pretend to be comprehensive. Instead, we will focus on exemplars of good theory.\n
        Course content Most courses on theory in the social sciences concentrate on
        the content of theories.\u00a0 In contrast, this class focuses on the canonical
        formats of various types of theories and what constitutes an adequate theory
        of a given type.\u00a0 The course will consider a number of types of theories,

        Illinois) (mspoole@illinois.edu) Course objectives \n  This course will introduce
        you to the nature of theory and theory construction in the social sciences.
        The topics it will explore include the following: the nature of explanation;
        theoretical types; strategies for theory construction; the relationship between
        theory and inquiry in social science research; evaluating and critiquing theories.\n  This
        course will also introduce you to a range of theories in the social sciences,
        particularly organizational science and organizational communication studies.\u00a0
        There are so many theories in such a wide range of contexts that we cannot
        pretend to be comprehensive. Instead, we will focus on exemplars of good theory.\n
        Course content Most courses on theory in the social sciences concentrate on
        the content of theories.\u00a0 In contrast, this class focuses on the canonical
        formats of various types of theories and what constitutes an adequate theory
        of a given type.\u00a0 The course will consider a number of types of theories,
        including causal theory, contingency theory, systems theory, network theory,
        several types of process theories and interpretive theory.\u00a0 It details
        the characteristics of each type of theory, how to build an effective theory

        genetics is concerned with the inheritance of those differences between individuals
        that are of degree rather than of kind (quantitative rather than qualitative).
        Such differences are seen for most human complex traits (e.g. depression,
        cognitive abilities or attention problems). When traits are classified into
        dichotomies (e.g. the population is characterized by affected and unaffected
        individuals), a quantitative distribution of liability may be assumed to model
        their inheritance. This course aims to provide the theoretical understanding
        of the inheritance of quantitative differences in behaviour, behavioural disorders,
        endophenotypes (e.g. blood pressure or brain volumes) underlying disease traits
        (e.g. hypertension or schizophrenia). Quantitative differences, as far as
        they are inherited, depend on genes with on average small effects and are
        usually influenced by gene differences at many loci. Consequently these genes
        cannot be identified by Mendelian segregation ratios (though they are subject
        to the laws of Mendelian transmission). The methods of quantitative genetics
        are characterized by studies of large populations and families / twins and
        by the fact that the nature of quantitative differences requires the measurement
        (and not just the classification) of individuals. The extension of Mendelian
        genetics into quantitative genetics will be made in two stages: the genetic
        properties of populations (population genetics) and the inheritance of measurements
        (biometrical genetics). Quantitative genetics is now merging with molecular
        genetics and the last part of this course will be devoted to methods for the
        localization and characterization of genes causing quantitative variation

        to the laws of Mendelian transmission). The methods of quantitative genetics
        are characterized by studies of large populations and families / twins and
        by the fact that the nature of quantitative differences requires the measurement
        (and not just the classification) of individuals. The extension of Mendelian
        genetics into quantitative genetics will be made in two stages: the genetic
        properties of populations (population genetics) and the inheritance of measurements
        (biometrical genetics). Quantitative genetics is now merging with molecular
        genetics and the last part of this course will be devoted to methods for the
        localization and characterization of genes causing quantitative variation
        and an introduction of epigenetics. Study Characteristics Course Description

        research methods.\n  Admission requirements: All participants are expected
        to be proficient in English. This is an advanced course on the craft of ethnography.
        We will explore the process of getting into the field, gathering data, and
        organizing and analyzing data to identify and theorize patterns in organizational
        life. In the last session we will discuss publishing so that you get a sense
        of the end of the line. However, the focus will be on the hard work of getting
        to that point. This is a hands-on course which will require that you practice
        the main skills required of ethnographers. We will collect new data and work
        with existing data. Download the course manual here. Study Characteristics

        Course objectives\u00a0 The goal of this course is to provide PhD candidates
        with high-quality guidance and information on conducting qualitative research
        allowing them to profit from the expertise about qualitative methods available
        in the FSS. At the end of the course, students \n  have gained knowledge of
        different qualitative methods of data collection and analysis\u00a0\n  understand
        the role and position of selected qualitative methods in interdisciplinary
        / multi-method research\u00a0\n  are able to link qualitative data to their
        PhD research questions\u00a0\n  have gained hands-on experience in designing
        and using selected qualitative methods tools and analyzing the relative data\u00a0\n  are
        able to critically reflect upon methodological choices and the implications
        for data analysis\u00a0\n Course content\u00a0 The course is meant for PhD
        candidates in different phases of their fieldwork: candidates both designing
        their methodological tools and who have already collected (some or all) field
        data will benefit from attending this course. There will be a practical focus
        on how to design qualitative data collection tools and choice of methods,
        as well as on how to analyze qualitative data and on the process of writing
        about results. Both social science students and students coming from non-social
        science disciplines are welcome to participate in this course. If the composition
        of students allows, the teachers plan to pay particular attention to multi-method

        Course objectives\u00a0 The goal of this course is to provide PhD candidates
        with high-quality guidance and information on conducting qualitative research
        allowing them to profit from the expertise about qualitative methods available
        in the FSS. At the end of the course, students \n  have gained knowledge of
        different qualitative methods of data collection and analysis\u00a0\n  understand
        the role and position of selected qualitative methods in interdisciplinary
        / multi-method research\u00a0\n  are able to link qualitative data to their
        PhD research questions\u00a0\n  have gained hands-on experience in designing
        and using selected qualitative methods tools and analyzing the relative data\u00a0\n  are
        able to critically reflect upon methodological choices and the implications
        for data analysis\u00a0\n Course content\u00a0 The course is meant for PhD
        candidates in different phases of their fieldwork: candidates both designing
        their methodological tools and who have already collected (some or all) field
        data will benefit from attending this course. There will be a practical focus
        on how to design qualitative data collection tools and choice of methods,
        as well as on how to analyze qualitative data and on the process of writing
        about results. Both social science students and students coming from non-social
        science disciplines are welcome to participate in this course. If the composition
        of students allows, the teachers plan to pay particular attention to multi-method
        and inter-disciplinary research approaches. PhD candidates in a before fieldwork
        phase will benefit from the course\u2019s relatively broad focus on a variety
        of qualitative methods, on their strengths and weaknesses, on their combination
        with other methods, and on important issues when planning the methods for

        Students VU Contemporary societal issues, such as those related to health
        care or sustainable development, are often very complex. They can be rooted
        in deep organizational, political and social issues that involvemany different
        actors, all with their own perspectives. For this reason, contemporary societal
        problems are often called \u2018wicked\u2019 or \u2018persistent\u2019 problems.
        Increasingly, the fields of global health and sustainable development research
        are recognizing the importance of defining these problems through the eyes
        of all actors involved. This implies that multiple approaches, fields of science
        and frames of reference are integrated to build specific, practical, experiential
        and scientific knowledge about the problem with those directly confronted
        with it. An interdisciplinary research approach, that aims for integrated
        knowledge generation is essential to do justice to the multi- faceted nature
        of persistent problems. Moreover, transdisciplinary research is rapidly becoming
        a key paradigm inresponding to wicked problems. Transdisciplinary research
        is distinct from mono-, multi- and interdisciplinary research. It integratesknowledge
        from different scientific actors with the experiential knowledge of societal
        actors (e.g. patients, health professionals, NGOs, government, industry, and
        international organizations), jointlyinvolving scientists and societal actors
        in defining problems and identifying and implementing interventions through
        mutual learning and co-creation. This new approach to research does come with
        some challenges. Among the challenges, transdisciplinary researchers must
        integrate various different knowledge cultures, incorporate actors needs and
        feedback, all while ensuring a safe and open venue for mutual learning and
        co-creation. In this course, PhD candidates will be exposed to, and will practice
        key skills within the design and implementation of inter- and transdisciplinary
        research. They will acquire a grounded understanding of epistemological cultures
        and how knowledge-value systems can challenge mutual learning. During the
        course, PhD candidates will use a case study format to redesign a mono- or
        multidisciplinary research project into an inter- or transdisciplinary research
        project. This will ensure practical exposure to stakeholder analysis, critical
        stakeholder feedback, and careful stakeholder communication skills before
        participants design and build their own PhD research proposal. The whole course
        consists of two parts. The first part (part I) concerns the preparatory reading
        prior to the start of the lecture series. The second part (part II) will be
        held remotely and includes lectures, workshops on 5 days spread out across
        May and June. This part also involves a group and individual assignment which
        students can work on between the scheduled sessions (except for PhD students
        in the final 6 months of their PhD trajectory, who will complete an additional
        individual assignment as an alternative to the group assignment). study characteristics

        often find themselves unprepared for work beyond academia? One of the major
        deficits which causes this unpreparedness is a lack in soft skills training.
        However, recent studies have shown that soft skills can be trained in a rather
        easy and fun way: by playing video games. Playing commercial video games are
        training millions of children and young people in soft skills everyday, probably
        without them being aware of it. That is why we started a pioneering research

        VU (and VU RMA students) This course provides an overview of leading innovative
        research and (para) medical treatments in the field locomotor disease, rehabilitation
        and movement sciences. Each topic of this module is designed around a clinical
        theme, i.e. a specific disease or disorder. A general introduction will include
        a discussion on the main clinical problems, related to the design of possible
        new treatments. This discussion will be focused on how methods and techniques
        from the several medical disciplines as well as the movement sciences are
        being applied to study and treat locomotor disease. Both neurological diseases
        (progressive as well as non progressive) as degenerative diseases of the skeletal
        system will be discussed. Also general principles of clinical movement analysis
        and outcome measurements are part of this module. Study Characteristics Course

        first lecture of each series a general introduction will be given. In subsequent

        students) In this course, the students are acquainted with biophysical and
        behavioural concepts that underlie current debates in HMS. One part of this
        course deals with behavioural concepts of HMS. Human movement is a complex
        behavior. To interpret this complex behavior, the scientific literature uses
        concepts that are rather complex themselves. Examples of such concepts are
        information, stability, synergy, internal representation and motor programs.
        In this course, questions such as \"What do these concepts mean exactly?\"
        and \"How do these concepts help us to understand the behavior we observe?\"
        will be addressed. A second part of the course deals with biomechanical concepts
        in particular with (in-)stability of joints and joint movement. Instability
        is often used in the clinical setting to describe the state of the joint after
        injury or in degenerative disorders. The term is often poorly defined, which
        leads to confusion in the communication between disciplines, e.g. between
        physiotherapists and orthopedic surgeons. Mechanics and control theory provide
        a rigorous framework for describing joint function. The relevance of this
        conceptual framework for the clinical context and the implications for diagnosis
        and treatment will be discussed. A third part of the course deals with physiological
        concepts in particular with the use of exercise intensity, relative workload
        and critical power. Relative workload is often used to induce similar loading
        of persons in sports and clinical studies, either to measure endurance or
        to induce a certain training stimulus. Relative workloads as percentage of
        maximal force/power or energy utilization (oxygen uptake) are used in various
        circumstances. While the choice for a given variable is essential for the
        result, it will be discussed whether the proper variables are chosen for the
        specific goals. Study Characteristics Course Description & Study Characteristics

        when feeling uncertain due to, for instance, an economic crisis and why? These
        are the kind of questions that we investigate as experimental researchers.
        In this course you will learn how to do experimental research. Contrary to
        a survey, an experiment enables a researcher to test a hypothesized causal
        relationship between an independent variable (e.g., uncertainty) and a dependent
        variable (e.g., sustainable behavior) by manipulating the independent variable
        (e.g., imagining an uncertain vs certain situation). In this course, we will
        dig deeper into the different phases of designing and conducting an experimental
        study. First, we will discuss how to come up with specific hypotheses, ready
        to be tested in an experimental context. Second, we discuss how to design
        and conduct an experiment in which you manipulate independent variable(s),
        measure dependent variable(s), and control for extraneous variable(s). Third,
        we discuss how to analyze the results from an experiment, with the appropriate
        statistical tools (SPSS). Finally, we discuss how to interpret the results
        of an experiment, eliminate alternative hypotheses, and design a set of follow-up
        studies. These discussions are set against the backdrop of actual examples

        We recommend students taking this course no sooner than in the second year

        an input block where we explain the fundamentals of academic impact and a

        will cover a full day. In between students have to work on an assignment,

        increasing attention from research organizations and science funders. In the
        Netherlands for instance \u2018Relevance to society\u2019 is one of three
        criteria in the national protocol for research assessments. Despite the fact
        that impact is a key objective of academia, it hardly plays a role in the
        education of young scholars. That is why this course provides an introduction
        to different forms of societal impact as well as to different quality regimes.
        In the course, participants learn, which strategies scholars can apply to
        have societal impact, which methods work in which cases, and how to develop
        an impact strategy that fits the specific type of academic work the individual

        consists of lectures and master classes. During the lectures, students becomes
        acquainted with current topics in global health, placed in a historical perspective.
        During the master classes,several fields of global health (including mental
        health, cross-cultural competencies and non-communicable diseases) are used
        to illustrate the complexity of disease burden in a global context and to
        build the case for multi/inter- and transdisciplinary analysis of complex

        organized as a lecture, in which the topic is approached from inter- and transdisciplinary
        perspectives. The second session is organized as a supervised workgroup, in
        which students discuss the most recent developments, as published in the literature,
        and thus become familiar with the different paradigms and models used in health.
        The research component of the course consists of lectures, workshops and an
        assignment. During the lectures and workshops, students acquire basic knowledge
        and skills on research design, different research paradigms, quantitative
        and qualitative research methods and the combination thereof (i.e., mixed-methods).
        During the assignment, students design a needs assessment for exploring the
        problems associated with one of the two topics: the prevention of HIV mother-to-child
        transmission in a specific context OR the prevention of peri-natal depression
        in mothers. The needs assessment is based on literature review and is conducted

        lecture introducing the main methodology taught in that week; - Two computer
        practicals in which students practice the main techniques and work on their
        assignments; - A closing workshops where students present their (draft) assignments
        and give each other feedback. See the daily schedule at the end of this document

        between actual performance and predicted performance. In this course, students
        will have to answer the question: Given a particular bike, what will be your

        should be based on a power-based simulation model of cycling and the relevant

        at a university is a complex affair. It is not simply a case of passing on
        information. It is the teacher\u2019s job and responsibility to create a learning
        environment in which students can actively acquire knowledge and academic
        skills and become increasingly independent in monitoring their own learning
        activities. The teacher\u2019s primary task is to support the student\u2019s
        learning process. This confronts teachers with a host of questions, like:
        How can I motivate students? How do I effectively prepare for classes? How
        do I give feedback to students? How can I improve student learning? How do
        I engage students with various interests and preferred methods of learning?
        How do I create a safe and inclusive learning environment in which all my
        students can thrive? In this course we will collectively shape your knowledge
        on teaching and search for answers on those questions. You can obtain a proof
        of participation for this course. If necessary (e.g., in case of changing
        employers), proof of participation for an individual module can be converted
        into a partial certificate for BKO. If you successfully complete all modules,

        & GitHub Software Carpentry workshops teach researchers basic research computing
        skills. This four half-days hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and
        tools needed for programming beginners (including program design, version
        control, data management, and task automation). This workshop will cover:
        \n  Task automation with Shell;\n  Version control with Git;\n  and basic
        programming and data visualization\u00a0 with Python.\n Participants will
        be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their
        own research problems. This is an introductory course aimed at researchers
        and PhD candidates who have little to no prior programming experience. However,
        all participants must have access to a computer with a Mac, Linux, or Windows
        operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that you have administrative
        privileges on. Study Characteristics Course Description & Study Characteristics

        methods: The course typically consists of 2 sessions per week, for 6 weeks,
        in the form of interactive tutorials (including a computer lab) and feedback
        sessions. There are many in-class exercises that students need to participate
        in, while in parallel, they work on their graded assignments. The main aim
        is to develop the students'' hands-on experience with doing qualitative research.\n  Assessment:
        Students have to hand in 4 (individual) assignments for grades; the final
        grade is the weighted average of all partial grades and must be a 5.5 or higher
        to successfully pass the course. The assignments and exact evaluation criteria
        for grading are explained in the course manual and discussed during the sessions.\n  This
        course is only available for research master and PhD students. All participating
        students are expected to be proficient in English. The course enables students
        to conduct in-depth, analytical, complexity-structuring qualitative empirical
        research, with a strong focus on the iterative process of data analysis. By
        going through several ''iterative cycles'' during the course, students will
        learn to conduct the various parts of qualitative research that fit with the
        elements of a qualitative research publication (design, methods, literature,
        empirical findings, discussion/ analysis, conclusion). Students will do a
        research project during the course. They will develop and use the technique
        of ''memo writing'' in order to fine-tune and further develop their project.
        They will also get acquainted with aspects of qualitative methods and techniques
        to do research in business administration, such as case studies, ethnography,
        grounded theory, interviews, observations, online data, and learn how to use
        computer assisted tools, process methods, and/or QCA. This advanced course
        is based on seminal work in journals such as AMR, AMJ, OSci, JMS, SMJ, ASQ,
        MISQ and taught by faculty who will use their own practical experience with
        publishing qualitative research. Please download the course manual here. Study

        students are expected to be proficient in English. The course enables students
        to conduct in-depth, analytical, complexity-structuring qualitative empirical
        research, with a strong focus on the iterative process of data analysis. By
        going through several ''iterative cycles'' during the course, students will
        learn to conduct the various parts of qualitative research that fit with the
        elements of a qualitative research publication (design, methods, literature,
        empirical findings, discussion/ analysis, conclusion). Students will do a
        research project during the course. They will develop and use the technique
        of ''memo writing'' in order to fine-tune and further develop their project.
        They will also get acquainted with aspects of qualitative methods and techniques
        to do research in business administration, such as case studies, ethnography,
        grounded theory, interviews, observations, online data, and learn how to use
        computer assisted tools, process methods, and/or QCA. This advanced course
        is based on seminal work in journals such as AMR, AMJ, OSci, JMS, SMJ, ASQ,
        MISQ and taught by faculty who will use their own practical experience with
        publishing qualitative research. Please download the course manual here. Study

        This course is an introduction to qualitative methods in the social sciences.
        The class will have five themes. The first will be a discussion on the relationship
        between method, methodology and epistemology and how the researcher\u2019s
        choices on all three issues necessarily influence the research. This will
        be a theoretical conversation. The next two themes will be practicing very
        practical skills of data collection and data analysis. The class will both
        learn about data collection and do a series of exercises where they experience
        field work and interview techniques. There will be time required outside of
        class time for these homework assignments. We will then discuss the analysis
        of data conceptually. Following this, participants will practice coding with
        two exercises. The fourth theme will be more theoretical, focusing on how
        to conceptualize patterns in qualitative data, to go from coding to analytic
        summaries to developing an argument. Finally, the last theme will be about
        effective skills for writing and publishing qualitative data in English language
        journals. The class will meet on three days, with two-hour sessions in the
        morning and afternoon. The active learning assignments will begin during class

        VU (and VU RMA students) This course will focus on using neuropsychology and
        neuroscience to understand psychopathology. It builds on the theoretical background
        in psychopathology which students have developed during the first year of
        the RMCDP programme. This course focuses on extending this knowledge by examining
        psychopathology using a brain and behaviour approach. Brain-behaviour relationships
        can be studied in diverse populations ranging from children to adults and
        patient populations to healthy controls. It is becoming increasingly clear
        that in the future innovative insights can greatly benefit from integrated
        studies of brain and cognition.\u00a0 During the first part of the course
        students will become acquainted with neuropsychological and neuroscientific
        research methods, and the ways in which these methods can be combined with
        those used in clinical, developmental and cognitive research to further understanding
        of mental disorders. These methods will subsequently be discussed relation
        to three dominant areas of neuroscience research within the field of psychopathology.
        The first, developmental neuroscience, examines normal and abnormal developmental
        trajectories. Childhood and adolescence are pivotal periods in shaping future
        mental health, and the origins of many disorders can be found during this
        period. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of neural development
        is essential to facilitate positive outcomes. The second area is affective
        neuroscience, a field of research which aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms
        of emotion processing, an ability which is often disturbed in those with mental
        health disorders. The third area, neuroeconomics, is a relatively new approach
        which combines paradigms from behavioural economics with neuroscience techniques.
        This relatively new field has already provided insights into the etiology
        of a diverse range of disorders, ranging from psychosis to bipolar disorder.
        \nDuring the second part of the course students will learn how to use these
        approaches to write a research proposal incorporating neuropsychological and/or
        neuroscientific methods. As well as writing the proposal, students will be
        encouraged to practice critically reflecting on their own work, and identifying
        strengths and weaknesses. \nStudents will receive feedback on their proposal

        This course is mainly geared towards helping you to develop your confidence
        about your written academic English. It shows you what you can do to improve
        your confidence in the short term, helps you to eradicate mistakes, and hopefully
        gives you new options for expressing complex ideas in well-structured English
        sentences. At the end of the course, you will have a clear idea of your strengths
        and weaknesses concerning written academic English. You will also be a better
        manager of your own text, and you will be equipped with a set of personalized
        criteria for editing your text. An additional aim is to give you support in
        approaching writing tasks. Course content Before the course you submit a text
        which the instructor will give feedback on before the first session. The actual
        course consists of six sessions. Session 1 is an introductory session: the
        lecturer will provide a presentation of participants\u2019 skills profiles,
        quick fixes, remedial grammar issues; and there is room for Q and A over matters
        arising from the individual feedback you received on your submitted text.
        The remaining sessions cover both a fixed set of topics related to clarity
        and coherence, and topics based on the specific needs of the participants.
        One session will focus on the writing process, helping you to work through
        the more difficult stages. Note that the content of the lectures of the intermediate
        track and the advanced track differ.\u00a0 Classes will contain a mix of interactive
        lecture elements and class exercises. There will be only a small amount of
        preparation during the two weeks of the course, but a lot of the work doesn\u2019t

        Module A: Human cooperation. Much of human thought, affect, and behavior is
        rooted in situations in which people can either be self-oriented or group-oriented.
        The goal is to advance our understanding of the factors that promote human
        cooperation. We will discuss interdependence, economic games, some neuroscience,
        all with the aim to increase our understanding of altruism, empathy,cooperation,
        revenge, and competition. Module B: Trust and Relationships: This module provides

        relationships. In so doing, we will discuss the contributions of an evolutionary
        approach to social psychology and a realist view on validity and measurement.
        With those conceptual tools under our belts, we will consider specific adaptive
        scenarios that might have given rise to the evolution of psychological mechanisms
        relevant to trust and relationships, and we will explore recent design evidence
        that opens the way for inferences about the existence of psychological adaptations
        for,for example, revenge and forgiveness. We will also review approaches to
        measuring relationship science, and revenge and forgiveness in the field and
        in the lab. In addition to faculty lectures and (hopefully) vigorous class

        Decolonization has become a powerful slogan calling to transform the humanities
        and social sciences and education at large. Scholars have denounced that the
        longstanding consequences of colonialism include the obliteration of diversity
        which ultimately impoverished our understanding of society, economics, or
        politics. In what concerns education, science and technology and the development
        of intellectual capacities, this move has been important for many reasons.
        First for recognizing that practices long established by modern European colonialism
        are silently entrenched within basic operations of knowledge production, including
        the formation of future scholars and scientists. The so-called decolonial
        turn has also helped us to understand that the obliteration of diversity \u2013
        understood as the annihilation of representation of different racial, gender
        and sexual, class and caste identities \u2013 is part of a project reinforced
        by European imperialism which started in the 15th century and damaged societies.
        In this course we will discuss literature, share ideas with guest speakers,
        and talk about our own experiences and practices as researchers. The ultimate
        aim is to find ways for renewed academic practices. Course objectives \n  To
        promote a welcoming, cooperative, non-competitive and yet intellectually challenging
        environment.\n  To introduce students to the names, semantics, theories, political
        commitment of scholars dedicated to discussing ideas of autonomy, dependency
        and liberatory projects.\n  To introduce students to \u201ctheories from the
        South\u201d as a strategy to discuss the history and the role of distinct
        sociological traditions to the development of politically engaged disciplinary
        projects.\n To address the theoretical-political engagement of critical pedagogies
        as a resourceful toolkit and method for inspiring collaborative ways for understanding
        the centrality attitudes and ethics in social sciences and the humanities.

        adequate individual guidance. The course \u2018Start to Supervise\u2019 gives
        you the basic skills for this. You will learn to address common problems in
        the supervision and assessment of graduation projects. You will explore methods
        to ''tailor'' the student''s learning proces and become aware on your level
        of competence as a professional. You will also practice effective student
        feedback and interview techniques. The course consists of two half-day meetings.
        You will also spend approximately 21 hours preparing and working out assignments.
        This course is a part of the UTQ program for PhD\u2019s. You can obtain a
        proof of participation for this course. If necessary (e.g., in case of changing

        and Busisiwe Radebe (b.radebe@vu.nl) Especially in the final phase of university
        studies, it is important to offer students adequate individual guidance. The
        course \u2018Start to Supervise\u2019 gives you the basic skills for this.
        You will learn to address common problems in the supervision and assessment
        of graduation projects. You will explore methods to ''tailor'' the student''s
        learning proces and become aware on your level of competence as a professional.
        You will also practice effective student feedback and interview techniques.
        The course consists of two half-day meetings. You will also spend approximately
        21 hours preparing and working out assignments. This course is a part of the
        UTQ program for PhD\u2019s. You can obtain a proof of participation for this
        course. If necessary (e.g., in case of changing employers), proof of participation
        for an individual module can be converted into a partial certificate for BKO.
        If you successfully complete all modules, you can, if you choose to, obtain
        your full BKO certificate. Also check the other courses for completing your
        full UTQ: \n \nTeaching\u00a0 Educational Design (link to UTQ flex) Study

        to profile: https://www.kathydavis.info The central task in qualitative analysis
        is finding ways to interpret the data that has been collected. This involves
        making sense of the data as well as connecting it to the researcher\u2019s
        specific questions and to the broader social, theoretical, or methodological
        issues in which the research is embedded. Attention is usually given to the
        collection of qualitative data and to how this data should be transcribed
        and ordered (often with the help of computer programs like Atlas, CAQDAS,
        Kwalitan). This leaves unaddressed how to interpret the material once it has
        been collected. This course addresses that lacuna.\u00a0 In the most hands-on
        way possible, we will be analyzing the participants\u2019 own qualitative
        data. This material can include interview transcripts, focus group discussions,
        ethnographic field notes, media texts or policy reports. Each participant
        will present an interpretative problem like, for example: How do I get started?
        What is happening in this interview? What does a particular sequence in a
        text or interview of group discussion mean? How do I decide between different
        interpretations and how do I link them to my theoretical framework? In each
        session we will analyze the work of two participants of the class.\u00a0 In
        addition to providing their own interpretative problem for discussion in the
        group, each participant is expected to actively participate in all the sessions
        because this is how the \u2018art of interpretation\u2019 can be learned and
        developed. The course will not be offered online so it is important that participants
        are able to attend all sessions in person. At the outset, some readings will
        be assigned primarily as a source of inspiration.\u00a0However, in the course
        of the class, additional readings may be assigned to elaborate the work being
        done in the group.\u00a0 Finally, participants will write a short essay (between
        1500 and 2500 words) using their own research material to demonstrate what
        they have learned about qualitative analysis and interpretation.\u00a0 Literature

        interpretations and how do I link them to my theoretical framework? In each
        session we will analyze the work of two participants of the class.\u00a0 In
        addition to providing their own interpretative problem for discussion in the
        group, each participant is expected to actively participate in all the sessions
        because this is how the \u2018art of interpretation\u2019 can be learned and
        developed. The course will not be offered online so it is important that participants
        are able to attend all sessions in person. At the outset, some readings will
        be assigned primarily as a source of inspiration.\u00a0However, in the course
        of the class, additional readings may be assigned to elaborate the work being
        done in the group.\u00a0 Finally, participants will write a short essay (between
        1500 and 2500 words) using their own research material to demonstrate what
        they have learned about qualitative analysis and interpretation.\u00a0 Literature

        Qualitative methods are ideally suited to zoom in on the lived experience

        age, the methodological toolboxes are renewed to reflect the complexities
        and dynamic character of online content. For instance, nowadays life stories
        are not only recorded through face-to-face interviews but also through life
        stories in the digital domain (e.g. Facebook, Instagram). Content analysis
        provides a powerful tool to capture the building blocks of interactions in
        the digital space and is useful for combining with quantitative methods. Digital

        grasp the bigger picture. Qualitative researchers need to learn \u2018to see
        the world in a grain of sand\u2019. In the digital age, the methodological
        toolboxes are renewed to reflect the complexities and dynamic character of
        online content. For instance, nowadays life stories are not only recorded
        through face-to-face interviews but also through life stories in the digital
        domain (e.g. Facebook, Instagram). Content analysis provides a powerful tool
        to capture the building blocks of interactions in the digital space and is
        useful for combining with quantitative methods. Digital ethnographies, or
        netnographies, show ways to capture social media\u2019s complexity in the
        lives of people. \u00a0 Language: English\n  ECTS: 6\n  Type of education:

        presence and engagement in the world, in society, in the church as well in
        believers\u2019 personal life. How can we discern God\u2019s presence? And
        how can we speak and think about God\u2019s absence? In the contemporary Evangelical
        and Reformed tradition, due to the increasing influence of charismatic movements,
        the presence of God is being emphasized by the attention for the Holy Spirit
        and the gifts of the Spirit like healing and prophecy. Due to this development,
        Gods presence is observed in the miraculous, understood as a \u2018supernatural\u2019,
        immediate encounter with God. At the same time, predominant within the Reformed
        tradition, presence of God is taken up in discussions on salvation and providence.
        Overall question in this course is how from various traditions within the
        Evangelical and Reformed tradition, we can speak of God\u2019s presence and
        absence, encounters of immediacy together with the question of discernment.
        Also, the dynamic interplay between beliefs and practices will be addressed
        by discussing the consequences of the various positions with regard to providence,
        secularization and mission, ecology and creation, church leadership, and charismatic
        practices.\u00a0 Additional Information Teaching Methods\u00a0 The student
        prepares the lectures by reading the specified literature\u00a0and or a practical
        assignment. In the classes the literature and or\u00a0assignment will be assessed
        by means of a guided discussion.\u00a0Students will give a presentation on

        Study Characteristics Course Description & Study Characteristics Course Description","SearchableContentOtherAnalyzer":"
        Marketing is a distinct research field with its own traditions and standards.
        It is typically divided into three interrelated sub fields; the areas of consumer
        behaviour, and marketing strategy and modelling. The advanced seminars in
        Marketing discuss key insights and recent advances in these subfields to gain
        understanding of the current issues and research challenges. Study period:
        May 2024 \u2013 June 2024 (Period 5)\u00a0\u00a0\n  Credits: 5 ECTS\u00a0\n  Tuition
        fee: \u20ac1250 (20% discount for early bird registration)\u00a0\n  Registration
        deadline: 18-03-2024 (early bird registration: 26-02-2024)\n  Recommendation:
        This is an ideal course for first year students.\n  Teaching methods: Weekly:
        Interactive lectures (four hours per week) over a period of 6 weeks, with
        a combination of lectures, student presentations and in-class discussions.\n  Assessment:
        The final grade consists of: two summary presentations (30%), individual paper
        (50%) and Final Presentation (20%).\n  Target group: Research master and PhD
        students with an interest in marketing, as well as students in the Pre-PhD
        Research Training Programme. Marketing is a research field with its own traditions
        and standards, drawing from psychology, economics and other disciplines. In
        this course we focus on the psychology-oriented area of consumer behavior
        and its translation into marketing strategy. The seminar revolves around\u00a0
        key insights and recent advances in marketing, with a focus on the societal
        impact \u2013 or, as we like to call it at VU School of Business and Economics:
        Marketing with Purpose. This course will draw on academic papers from leading
        journals. It is built around interactive discussions about recent articles
        in the field. In addition to giving an overview of Marketing with Purpose,
        the course also serves to get you acquainted with academic research in marketing
        at VU. Participants are expected to actively participate in class discussions

        this process. Discover what kind of support is available and how you can take
        the first steps towards creating impact through your research or idea. Duration:
        3 hours\n Date: February / March 2024 - will be announced soon\n Location:
        Amsterdam knowledge institution Module 3: Impact through research: focusing
        on your own practice In this third module you will work on your own idea.
        During two interactive half-day sessions you will further develop and concretise
        your idea. At the end of these sessions you will know how to achieve impact.
        You will have an overview of the steps to be take in a clear plan, and you
        will know how to make a network analysis that can help you further. Study

        VU (and VU RMA students) You will learn how to design psychological experiments
        and how to implement these using the OpenSesame software package and the Python
        programming language. You will be mainly working with OpenSesame, which is
        specially designed for constructing experiments. To successfully create experiments
        in OpenSesame, however, you need a basic understanding of Python. Therefore
        this course will also address general programming principles that will facilitate
        the learning of other programming languages in the future. We will furthermore
        look at how to efficiently design behavioral experiments, with the focus on

        in order to pass the course. Course Objective\u00a0 The course has the following
        learning objectives:\u00a0 - The student is able to explain how gender, sexuality,
        race/ethnicity, national identity and other forms of difference figure in
        contemporary public debates on religion in contemporary Western societies.\u00a0
        - The student knows how to use the method of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA),
        using the conceptual toolbox offered in this course\u00a0 - The student is
        able to compare the social construction of religions in relation to each other
        and in relation to secularity\u00a0 Course Content\u00a0 In public debate
        in secularized Western societies, religion is often portrayed as a cause for
        polarization. Through debates on religious bodies, practices, public visibility
        and speech acts, the place of religion in modern societies is regulated. Issues
        of gender, sexuality, national identity and race/ethnicity figure prominently
        in these debates. Different actors have different stakes in defining religion
        in certain ways, or mobilizing certain concepts when talking about religion:
        often the problematization of religion seems to function as a way to mark
        dominant secular identities as distinct from gendered, sexualized and racialized
        religious Others. This has become even more pressing since debates about immigration,
        Islam and multiculturalism have become more prominent in countries such as
        the Netherlands.\u00a0 In this course we explore the dynamics of public debate
        on religion against this backdrop, focussing on how religion, religious and
        secular identities are constructed in public discourse in contemporary Western
        societies, with an emphasis on Europe and the Netherlands. The aim of this
        course is to analyse the ways in which religion in public discourse is constructed
        along the lines of gender, sexuality and race, and to be able to suggest alternatives
        to harmful (e.g. generalizing, stereotypical, exclusionary) representations.
        The method taught and used in this course is that of Critical Discourse Analysis,

        the existence of an unmoved mover, Anselm\u2019s argument for the\u00a0\nexistence
        of a being than which none greater can be imagined, Leibniz\u2019s\u00a0argument
        for the existence of a necessary being that is the cause of all\u00a0contingents,

        for God''s existence that are discussed include\u00a0cosmological, teleological,

        against God\u2019s existence to be\u00a0discussed include the argument from

        substantial individual variation which can be explained to a large extent
        by differences in the genetic makeup of individuals. It is therefore of crucial
        importance to gain knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of normal and, in
        particular, abnormal behaviour. For example, knowledge about the genetic variants
        that underlie psychiatric conditions such as ADHD, depression and schizophrenia
        provides keys to obtain more in-depth understanding of the underlying pathophysiology.
        In addition identification of relevant genes affords the ability to predict
        at risk people and can provide novel insights to improve care and pave the
        way to the application of personalised interventions. To date the search for
        genetic variants that influence behaviour and elucidation of the biological
        pathways through which they do so remains a tremendous scientific challenge.
        This of course reflects the complexity of behavioural traits as well as their
        highly polygenetic background. An added problem is that detailed quantitative
        descriptions of abnormal behaviours and psychiatric diseases are generally
        lacking. Current health diagnostic systems generally entail only qualitative
        appraisals of behaviour symptoms or psychiatric disorders, i.e., \"one has
        a symptom or disorder or not\". Instead of behaviour itself, quantitative
        measures of specific nervous system function that underlie final output behaviour
        likely are more closely linked to genetic variation and therefore help elucidate
        the pathways by which these genetic variants influence behaviour. Measuring
        these biomarkers, or \"endophenotypes\", can furthermore help us understand
        how these genes exert their effect by highlighting the associated functional
        neurobiological changes. Discipline: Psychology\n  Type of education: In class\n  Academic

        this course we will focus on biomarkers from the central nervous system (brain),
        obtained by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and biomarkers from the autonomic
        nervous system, obtained by the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the impedance
        cardiogram (ICG). Students are introduced to the basic methodology required
        to obtain the raw data for both modalities, as well as the subsequent analysis
        steps needed to arrive at final quantitative measures. For MRI this includes
        learning how to obtain measures of global and local brain structure from T1
        weighted images, and parameters indicating brain connectivity from Diffusion
        Tensor Images (DTI), and measures of brain function and indicators of functional
        networks from Echo Planar Images (EPI). For ECG, students will learn the practical
        skills to record psychophysiological signals and analyzing and scoring these
        signals to obtain measures of heart rate variability and cardiac impedance
        parameters such as the preejection period (PEP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia
        (RSA) related to cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic drive, respectively.
        Based on published work from the scientific literature it will then be demonstrated
        how this brain and cardiovascular imaging information can be combined with
        basic molecular information on the individual\u2019s genomes in the context

        Course Description","SearchableContentOtherAnalyzer":" Human behaviour shows
        substantial individual variation which can be explained to a large extent
        by differences in the genetic makeup of individuals. It is therefore of crucial
        importance to gain knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of normal and, in
        particular, abnormal behaviour. For example, knowledge about the genetic variants
        that underlie psychiatric conditions such as ADHD, depression and schizophrenia
        provides keys to obtain more in-depth understanding of the underlying pathophysiology.
        In addition identification of relevant genes affords the ability to predict
        at risk people and can provide novel insights to improve care and pave the
        way to the application of personalised interventions. To date the search for
        genetic variants that influence behaviour and elucidation of the biological
        pathways through which they do so remains a tremendous scientific challenge.
        This of course reflects the complexity of behavioural traits as well as their
        highly polygenetic background. An added problem is that detailed quantitative
        descriptions of abnormal behaviours and psychiatric diseases are generally
        lacking. Current health diagnostic systems generally entail only qualitative
        appraisals of behaviour symptoms or psychiatric disorders, i.e., \"one has
        a symptom or disorder or not\". Instead of behaviour itself, quantitative
        measures of specific nervous system function that underlie final output behaviour
        likely are more closely linked to genetic variation and therefore help elucidate
        the pathways by which these genetic variants influence behaviour. Measuring
        these biomarkers, or \"endophenotypes\", can furthermore help us understand
        how these genes exert their effect by highlighting the associated functional
        neurobiological changes. Discipline: Psychology\n  Type of education: In class\n  Academic

        this course we will focus on biomarkers from the central nervous system (brain),
        obtained by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and biomarkers from the autonomic
        nervous system, obtained by the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the impedance
        cardiogram (ICG). Students are introduced to the basic methodology required
        to obtain the raw data for both modalities, as well as the subsequent analysis
        steps needed to arrive at final quantitative measures. For MRI this includes
        learning how to obtain measures of global and local brain structure from T1
        weighted images, and parameters indicating brain connectivity from Diffusion
        Tensor Images (DTI), and measures of brain function and indicators of functional
        networks from Echo Planar Images (EPI). For ECG, students will learn the practical
        skills to record psychophysiological signals and analyzing and scoring these
        signals to obtain measures of heart rate variability and cardiac impedance
        parameters such as the preejection period (PEP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia
        (RSA) related to cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic drive, respectively.
        Based on published work from the scientific literature it will then be demonstrated
        how this brain and cardiovascular imaging information can be combined with
        basic molecular information on the individual\u2019s genomes in the context
        of Genome Wide Association or candidate gene designs, to pinpoint relevant
        genetic variation and understand the functional consequences of specific genes
        on brain and cardiac system level. Important findings and their implications

        Course objectives: \u2022\tAfter this workshop you have been introduced in
        the Minto approach \u2022\tYou know if it can help you to structure your future
        texts or restructure your present texts\u00a0 \u2022\tIt can also be used
        to organize and structure your qualitative data, interviews and field reports
        Introducing Minto writing\u00a0 In the first session Minto\u2019s ideas will
        be presented. I will illustrate to what extent they appear in Bouwmeester
        and Kok (2018), and how they relate to current ideas about academic writing
        (White 2005). The second part of the session will be a group reflection, where
        the participants suggest an article (or book if their PhD will be a monograph)
        in need pf a better structure, and where they believe Minto\u2019s approach
        of organizing a text could be an inspiring provocation. Preparation: Read
        Minto (1998a&b); Bouwmeester and Kok (2018); White (2005)\u00a0 Applying the
        pyramid principle When working on the body of a text (after the introduction),
        paragraphs can be structured in different ways. Minto distinguishes between
        vertical and horizontal relationships in a text, and they should both be well
        crafted. On top of that she has suggestions for designing good headings. After
        a short recap of Mintos ideas participants will make a pyramid for the theory
        and results sections of a text of their choice on only one PowerPoint slide.
        During the workshop we will reflect on these pyramids.\u00a0 Preparation:
        Read Minto (1998a); Bansal and Corley (2012) and Gioia et al. (2013). Do some
        first thinking along the lines of Minto to restructure the body of your selected
        text. Bring your laptop! Writing introductions in Minto style\u00a0 You can
        only write introductions after you know what needs to be introduced. When
        pyramids are established, it is possible to write an introduction in Minto
        style. During the third session we will work on introductions to the studies
        we have made pyramids for. After a short recap of the theory participant make
        one PowerPoint slide with the main ingredients of their introduction and are
        asked to present this one slide before the group in about 5 minutes each.

        Course Content\u00a0 This exegetical course is part of the\u202fConflicting
        Identities in Early Christianity\u202fresearch group of our Faculty. The book
        of Acts (also called\u202fThe Acts of the Apostles) is about tensions of an
        emerging religious movement \u2013 from an early group of Jesus followers
        in the early decades of first-century Palestine to more organized Christian
        communities all over the Roman empire later on. From a literary perspective,
        it is a story full of adventure. Acts includes travel narratives, riots and
        local conflicts, prison escapes, sea voyages and shipwrecks. Spectacular things
        happen: from a skyride into heaven (the Ascension), and a mass-happening with
        wind and fire (Pentecost) to supernatural healings, exorcisms, and many other
        miraculous events. It is a book about preaching, community-building, hospitality
        and above all, it is about identity, an identity-in-the-making and a contested
        identity. From a historical perspective, it is one of the few sources that
        tell us about the earliest stages of the early Christian movement. Narrated
        from a \u201cLukan\u201d perspective, questions have been raised about the
        way the author portrays the early community (too idealistic?), and how he
        portrays Paul\u2019s theology (a misrepresentation?). Theologically, it contains
        a universal message of salvation but also demonstrations of divine wrath (Judas,
        Annanias and Sapphira, Herod) and punishment (Simon Magus, Bar-Jesus, sons
        of Sceva), which to many contemporary readers raise theological and ethical
        questions. Finally, the book of Acts is about religious conflicts and social
        pressures, and defining, redefining and broadening social and religious boundaries.
        In this course, selected passages of Acts will be exegeted with the help of
        current scholarly research tools, with a view to academic, professional and
        societal questions. The focus will be on the exegesis of Acts 1 and 2, which
        set the tone for the entire book and in which a number of these issues play
        a role.\u00a0 Additional Information Teaching Methods\u00a0 Educational approach:
        Class instructions, exegetical assignments, independent research and literature
        study, presentations of work in progress, feedback sessions, guest lecture
        (provisional), paper.\u00a0 Classes are mandatory; meetings will not be recorded.
        Only in exceptional cases (e.g. students working from abroad) online participation
        will be allowed.\u00a0 Study load: This course has a study load of 168 hours
        (6 EC). The aim of the exercise is to get the job done within the limited
        number of hours available for this module (anticipating on the unruly professional
        practice, in which you will also have to plan your activities closely and
        you cannot delve endlessly into a certain subject). So keep a close eye on
        your schedule! The study load is calculated as follows:\u00a0 \n  Classroom

        hrs of study: N/A\n  Available to: PhD students VU (and VU RMA students) Upon
        successful completion of the course, students are expected to be able to:
        \n  describe the epigenetic mechanisms employed in human cells and their role
        in development and cell identity\n  relate these mechanisms to the effects
        of DNA polymorphisms and social and environmental factors that elicit individual
        differences in behaviour and health\n  explain array-based and sequencing
        techniques to measure genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA\n  interpret and
        cite research described in key scientific publications in expert journals
        such as Genome Biology, Epigenetics, and Nature\n  perform quality control
        and normalization of genome-wide DNA methylation datasets\n  perform an epigenome-wide
        association study and interpret results\n  compare research designs and summarize
        challenges in epigenetics\u00a0\n Though our genetic material (DNA sequence)
        may be relatively fixed, the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the expression
        of our genes vary across cell types and are subject to changes during development
        and in response to external influences. Epigenomics is concerned with the
        study of epigenetic mechanisms on a genome-wide scale. Sequencing is a technique
        that is applied for typing DNA, RNA, or DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale
        at the maximum resolution. This course aims to provide students with the theoretical
        background and with the analytical skills required to analyse and interpret
        genome-wide epigenomic data in the context of human epigenetic epidemiology
        research. Students will understand how life circumstances may alter gene expression
        and lead to individual differences in behaviour and health. The theoretical
        part, covered by lectures and a textbook, provides an understanding of the
        various epigenetic mechanisms employed in human cells, our current understanding
        of their role in behaviour and health, the techniques to measure whole genome
        DNA methylation and RNA including array-based methods and sequencing, and
        the research designs, quality control of data, statistical analysis, and challenges
        in human epigenetic epidemiology. A significant part of this course will be
        devoted to hands-on computer practical work in which the student will analyse
        epigenomic data (mostly DNA methylation arrays) from the Netherlands Twin
        Register in combination with survey data (e.g. environmental indicators).
        These practical assignments are intended to familiarize students with all
        aspects of the analysis of epigenomic data: from the initial data quality
        control and normalization to performing an epigenome-wide association study.
        The course duration is 4 weeks. The first 3 weeks consist of lectures and
        practicals. The course will end with a final integrative data analysis assignment,
        and with a written exam in week 4. Study characteristics Learning objectives

        hrs of study: N/A\n  Available to: PhD students VU (and VU RMA students) Upon
        successful completion of the course, students are expected to be able to:
        \n  describe the epigenetic mechanisms employed in human cells and their role
        in development and cell identity\n  relate these mechanisms to the effects
        of DNA polymorphisms and social and environmental factors that elicit individual
        differences in behaviour and health\n  explain array-based and sequencing
        techniques to measure genome-wide DNA methylation and RNA\n  interpret and
        cite research described in key scientific publications in expert journals
        such as Genome Biology, Epigenetics, and Nature\n  perform quality control
        and normalization of genome-wide DNA methylation datasets\n  perform an epigenome-wide
        association study and interpret results\n  compare research designs and summarize
        challenges in epigenetics\u00a0\n Though our genetic material (DNA sequence)
        may be relatively fixed, the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the expression
        of our genes vary across cell types and are subject to changes during development
        and in response to external influences. Epigenomics is concerned with the
        study of epigenetic mechanisms on a genome-wide scale. Sequencing is a technique
        that is applied for typing DNA, RNA, or DNA methylation on a genome-wide scale
        at the maximum resolution. This course aims to provide students with the theoretical
        background and with the analytical skills required to analyse and interpret
        genome-wide epigenomic data in the context of human epigenetic epidemiology
        research. Students will understand how life circumstances may alter gene expression
        and lead to individual differences in behaviour and health. The theoretical
        part, covered by lectures and a textbook, provides an understanding of the
        various epigenetic mechanisms employed in human cells, our current understanding
        of their role in behaviour and health, the techniques to measure whole genome
        DNA methylation and RNA including array-based methods and sequencing, and
        the research designs, quality control of data, statistical analysis, and challenges
        in human epigenetic epidemiology. A significant part of this course will be
        devoted to hands-on computer practical work in which the student will analyse
        epigenomic data (mostly DNA methylation arrays) from the Netherlands Twin
        Register in combination with survey data (e.g. environmental indicators).
        These practical assignments are intended to familiarize students with all
        aspects of the analysis of epigenomic data: from the initial data quality
        control and normalization to performing an epigenome-wide association study.
        The course duration is 4 weeks. The first 3 weeks consist of lectures and
        practicals. The course will end with a final integrative data analysis assignment,
        and with a written exam in week 4. Study characteristics Learning objectives

        This is an ideal course for first year students.\n  The course consists of
        hands-on tutorials, alternated with more generic reflections on the materials
        when needed, It is very important that you actively apply what you\u2019ve
        learned during the tutorials. Practice is vital to mastering a programming
        language. We will meet at least twice a week in the first two weeks of the
        course, and twice a week in week 5 and 6. You are expected to work on the
        assignments in the weeks where no tutorials are planned. Each session lasts
        about 4 hours. Although the tutorials are not mandatory, your attendance is
        highly recommended to keep up with the course materials. During the course
        you\u2019ll work on two assignments. During week 1-4, you work on assignment
        1 (available on Canvas). During week 5-8 you work on assignment 2. Note that
        at the start of week 5 we introduce assignment 2. At the end of week 3 (Friday
        23.59) and the end of week 6 (Friday 23.59) you have to submit drafts of your
        assignments using Canvas. These drafts will receive feedback from your fellow
        students. At the end of the course you need to hand-in a revised version of
        both assignments. Please prepare for the tutorials by reading the assignment
        beforehand and downloading the data in advance.\n  Assessments: Your overall
        course grade is based on two assignments. During the course you will work
        on these two assignments. You submit each assignment twice: first you receive
        feedback from another student (and have to give feedback to the same student),
        the second time you receive a grade. The quality of the feedback you provide
        will be graded by the lecturers, and each counts for 10% of your grade. The
        final submission of the assignments will be graded and count for 40% each.
        The overall course grade needs to be a 5.50 or higher.\n  Admission requirements:
        All participants are expected to be proficient in English The understanding
        of research methods to analyse large datasets and how these methods can be
        used to compare countries and cultures becomes ever more important. To use
        analytics to solve research problems, you need to have a solid background
        not only in the available statistical methods, but also in the inherent boundaries
        of these statistical methods. This course teaches technical skills while simultaneously
        deepening the understanding of modelling, research designs, and the limitations
