    registry: >
      <p>DReSA makes it easier for learners, trainers, and training providers to find digital research skills-focused
      educational events and resources.</p>
      <p>Through DReSA, its creators seek to: <ul>
      <li>Lift Australasian researchers' capabilities and skills by improving the findability of events and resources</li>
      <li>Build national, collaborative, training partnerships</li>
      <li>Strategically leverage trainers' and learners' time and resources</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>DReSA began as a grassroots movement among trainers and training providers in Australia and New Zealand to improve
      the discoverability of training. After scoping the landscape for similar solutions, the Working Group located
      ELIXIR's TeSS platform. From there, began a truly collaborative, global partnership with ELIXIR and an exchange
      of, not only the infrastructure that underlies TeSS, but also the ideas, support and encouragement.</p>
    events: >
      <p>Events in DReSA are defined as face-to-face or online training opportunities that have set start and end times.
      These primarily take the form of workshops, courses, webinars, etc.</p>
      <p>DReSA also collects information about conferences, meetings, and hackathons, as these may also provide
      opportunities for learning.</p>
    nominatim: "<a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim', target='_blank'>Nominatim</a>"
    materials: >
      Materials in DReSA are defined as training resources that can be accessed at any time. These may be in
      a variety of different formats, including online tutorials, videos, PowerPoint presentations, and so on.

    subscribe: >
      DReSA also provides a subscription feature to help users to stay informed about training events of interest to
      them. The service may be customised by selecting the relevant filters, and initiated via the subscribe button.
      Users may choose to receive email notifications about upcoming events, or have them automatically added to their
      preferred calendar application.
    widgets: >
      providers, institutions and organizations may readily import information, about relevant events and materials, to
      their site using widgets. Alternatively, they can create custom feeds using our API.

      description: >
        <p>The idea for a training registry and calendar had been bubbling away for some time. Seen by trainers and
        training providers as a challenge to tackle, DReSA was born out of the need to improve the discoverability of
        training. The Working Group formed at the ARDC Skills Summit 2020, as a result of active participation,
        collaboration and a common objective. A key first step was to scan the landscape for similar solutions, with
        the Working Group identifying ELIXIR's TeSS platform as a likely exemplar. From there began a truly
        collaborative and global partnership with ELIXIR and an exchange of the infrastructure that underlies TeSS, and
        also ideas, support and encouragement.</p>

      <p>Adding events to DReSA make them easier to find for learners, trainers and other training providers.
      This can help attract bigger audiences and increase the reach and impact of your events.</p>
    methods: >
      <p>To add an event to DReSA:<ol>
      <li>Create a user profile, by logging in using the Australian Access Federation (AAF)</li>
      <li>And either:<ul>
      <li>Use our form to register events <a href="#manual">manually</a>, or</li>
      <li>Contact us to develop an <a href="#automatic">automatic registration</a> solution.</li>
      </ul></li></ol></p>
      <p>Events added to DReSA must be related to digital research skills and must take place, or be open to
      researchers, in the Australasian region.</p>
    automatic: >
      <p>The DReSA team can provide various automated scraping solutions for adding your events to the website.
      Scrapers are based on the extraction of structured metadata from existing websites.</p>
      <p>If those solutions are not applicable, you can contact the DReSA team to discuss potential, alternative
      solutions. This option is particularly useful if you regularly add many events to DReSA.</p>
      <p>For more information on automatically registering events in DReSA, refer to the
      <a href="https://github.com/nrmay/TeSS_scrapers/" target="_blank">DReSA Scrapers</a> repository.<p>
    auto_condition_1: "Contains more than 3 resources"
    auto_condition_2: "Has some structured data"
    auto_condition_3: "Is relevant to life scientists"
    structured: >
      <p>To register resources in TeSS automatically, our scrapers need to be able to extract data from target
      websites reliably. To this end, it is helpful if these websites include some structured data.</p>
      <p>The following are examples of the kinds of structured data that we can work with. If your website contains one
      or more of these, and satisfies the criteria above, contact us and we will create a scraper.</p>
      <p>If your website includes no structured data, and you’d like your resources added to TeSS, we recommend using
      <a href="http://bioschemas.org" target="_blank">Bioschemas</a> to structure your site.</p>
    schema: >
      <p><a href='http://schema.org', target='_blank'>Schema.org</a> is a project run by a consortiumof search engines.
      Schema.org has created an extensive library of simple, lightweight schemas that web-masters can use to explicitly
      define their websites content in order to improve search engine visibility and interoperability.</p>
      <p>For events, you can use the <a target='_blank', href='http://schema.org/Event'>schema.org Event type</a>; and
      for training materials: <a target='_blank', href='http://schema.org/CreativeWork'>schema.org CreativeWork Type</a>
      </p><p>The schemas provided by schema.org are convoluted, and lack some important training-specific fields.
      As such, a life science community group, called <a target='_blank', href='http://bioschemas.org'>Bioschemas</a>,
      has created schema.org extensions with life science-specific vocabularies, which add additional fields relevant
      to the discipline.</p>
      <p>The Bioschemas group is producing tools, documents and training to facilitate adoption of standard metadata
      mark-up.</p>

      <p>If your website has a calendar application, the TeSS team can write a scraper to extract from it the date,
      location and event descriptions, and upload the data to TeSS.</p>
