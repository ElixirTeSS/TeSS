      One of the goals of <a href='https://elixir-europe.org', target='_blank'>Elixir</a>
      (Europe's distributed infrastructure for life-science data) is to train research scientists to better use
      available computational infrastructures to address critical research questions. This requires access both to
      face-to-face training opportunities and to disparate training materials and resources, currently dispersed
      across Europe.
      </p><p>
      TeSS is ELIXIR's training platform, providing a one-stop shop for trainers and trainees to discover
      online information and content, including training materials, events and interactive tutorials.
      For ELIXIR Nodes, TeSS provides opportunities to promote training events and news, and to contribute
      to a growing catalogue of materials; for trainers, the portal offers an environment for sharing materials
      and event information; for trainees, it offers a convenient gateway via which to identify relevant training
      events and resources, and to perform specific, guided analysis tasks via customised training workflows
    events: >
      Events in TeSS are defined as face-to-face or online training opportunities that have set start and end times.
      These primarily take the form of workshops, courses, webinars, etc.; but TeSS also collects information about
      conferences, meetings and hackathons, as these may also provide opportunities for learning.
      </p><p>
      A significant portion of TeSS' initial content was contributed by the progenitor event-announcement platform,
      <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23742982" target="_blank">iAnn.pro</a>.
    nominatim: "<a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim', target='_blank'>Nominatim</a>"
    materials: >
      Materials in TeSS are defined as training resources that can be accessed at any time. These may be in
      a variety of different formats, including online tutorials, videos, PowerPoint presentations, and so on.
    workflows: >
      New to TeSS are graphical training tools termed 'Training Workflows'.
      Three main types of workflow are in development: Educational Resources, Learning Pathways and Concept Maps.
      These encapsulate different types of, and/or approaches to, training, at different levels of granularity,
      within easy-to-use visual displays.
    learning_paths: >
      In order to advance their skills, trainees need to embark on a path, or developmental trajectory.
      To facilitate this journey, learning paths aim to structure, within simple visual workflows, the set of
      relevant training resources that trainees need to study in order to accomplish their learning objectives.
      Learning paths are being developed by ELIXIR TeSS, ELIXIR-NL and ELIXIR UK.
    concept_maps: >
      ELIXIR has developed several registries that contain and promote a variety of resources that users can
      exploit: training resources in TeSS; software tools in
      <a href="https://bio.tools" target="_blank">bio.tools</a>; databases, standards and policies in
      <a href="https://fairsharing.org" target="_blank">FAIRsharing</a>. Concept maps provide visual overviews
      of typical data-analysis pipelines, surfacing the relevant tools and databases from these registries,
      and showing how they fit together. Concept maps are being developed by ELIXIR TeSS, ELIXIR-EE and ELIXIR-BE.
    resources: >
      In this type of workflow, trainees are introduced to various practical tasks, linked to associated
      online tools and/or databases, within self-contained modules. Each module includes
      i) succinct statements of teaching goals and learning outcomes, to convey to trainees what they will be able to do
      on completion of the module;
      ii) a series of questions or ‘Reflections’ to provoke critical thinking about the tasks that have been completed;
      iii) additional background information and further reading to help support learning and enquiry; and
      iv) multiple choice quiz questions to evaluate understanding at the end.
      Educational Resources for introductory sequence and structural bioinformatics are currently being developed by
      ELIXIR TeSS, ELIXIR-UK and the UK Structural Bioinformatics group (via the FunPDBe project).
    subscribe: >
      TeSS also provides a subscription feature to help users to stay informed about courses, workshops and
      conferences of interest to them. The service may be customised by selecting the relevant filters, and
      initiated via the subscribe button. Users may choose to receive email notifications about upcoming
      events, or have them automatically added to their preferred calendar application.

      <p>Training resources (events and materials) may be added to TeSS to reach bigger audiences, increase impact and
      bolster event attendance. Registering events and training materials makes them more findable in a variety ways
      to various user bases.</p>
    methods: >
      <p>There are two ways to register training materials or events for display in TeSS:
      <ol><li>Arrange for an <a href="#automatic">automatic registration</a> solution;</li>
      <li>Use our form to register them <a href="#manual">manually</a>.</li></ol></p>
    automatic: >
      The TeSS team can write scripts ('scrapers') to automatically register resources from target websites.
      The scrapers run each night, adding any new resources to TeSS or updating any that have changed.
      We can write a scraper to include your resources in TeSS, if your site:
    auto_condition_1: "Contains more than 3 resources"
    auto_condition_2: "Has some structured data"
    auto_condition_3: "Is relevant to life scientists"
    structured: >
      <p>To register resources in TeSS automatically, our scrapers need to be able to extract data from target
      websites reliably. To this end, it is helpful if these websites include some structured data.</p>
      <p>The following are examples of the kinds of structured data that we can work with. If your website contains one or
      more of these, and satisfies the criteria above, contact us and we will create a scraper.</p>
      <p>If your website includes no structured data, and you’d like your resources added to TeSS, werecommend using
      <a href="http://bioschemas.org" target="_blank">Bioschemas</a> to structure your site.</p>
    schema: >
      <p><a href='http://schema.org', target='_blank'>Schema.org</a> is a project run by a consortiumof search engines.
      Schema.org has created an extensive library of simple, lightweight schemas that web-masters can use to explicitly
      define their websites content in order to improve search engine visibility and interoperability.</p>
      <p>For events, you can use the <a target='_blank', href='http://schema.org/Event'>schema.org Event type</a>; and
      for training materials: <a target='_blank', href='http://schema.org/CreativeWork'>schema.org CreativeWork Type</a>
      </p><p>The schemas provided by schema.org are convoluted, and lack some important training-specific fields.
      As such, a life science community group, called <a target='_blank', href='http://bioschemas.org'>Bioschemas</a>,
      has created schema.org extensions with life science-specific vocabularies, which add additional fields relevant
      to the discipline.</p>
      <p>The Bioschemas group is producing tools, documents and training to facilitate adoption of standard metadata
      mark-up.</p>

      <p>Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, typically have endpoint URLs that, when accessed, return raw,
      unstyled data in a common exchange format, such as XML or JSON.</p>

      <p>If your website has a calendar application, the TeSS team can write a scraper to extract from it the date,
      location and event descriptions, and upload the data to TeSS.</p>
