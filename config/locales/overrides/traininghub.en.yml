    registry: >
      The Training Hub was established in 2023 to support, consolidate, and enable access to the SciLifeLab 
      infrastructure’s knowledge, skills and expertise. 
    history: >
      We are building a portal where the Swedish life science community can find opportunities to gain 
      relevant skills, and experts can find support in creating training that captures their knowledge.
      To learn more about what we are planning, find our 2023-2028 Roadmap here.

    events: >
      Events in TeSS are defined as face-to-face or online training opportunities that have set start and end times.
      These primarily take the form of workshops, courses, webinars, etc.; but TeSS also collects information about
      conferences, meetings and hackathons, as these may also provide opportunities for learning.
    nominatim: "<a href='https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Nominatim</a>"
    materials: >
      Materials in TeSS are defined as training resources that can be accessed at any time. These may be in
      a variety of different formats, including online tutorials, videos, PowerPoint presentations, and so on.
    workflows: >
      New to TeSS are graphical training tools termed 'Training Workflows'.
      Three main types of workflow are in development: Educational Resources, Learning Pathways and Concept Maps.
      These encapsulate different types of, and/or approaches to, training, at different levels of granularity,
      within easy-to-use visual displays.
    learning_paths: >
      In order to advance their skills, trainees need to embark on a path, or developmental trajectory.
      To facilitate this journey, learning paths aim to structure, within simple visual workflows, the set of
      relevant training resources that trainees need to study in order to accomplish their learning objectives.
      Learning paths are being developed by ELIXIR TeSS, ELIXIR-NL and ELIXIR UK.
    resources: >
      In this type of workflow, trainees are introduced to various practical tasks, linked to associated
      online tools and/or databases, within self-contained modules. Each module includes
      i) succinct statements of teaching goals and learning outcomes, to convey to trainees what they will be able to do
      on completion of the module;
      ii) a series of questions or ‘Reflections’ to provoke critical thinking about the tasks that have been completed;
      iii) additional background information and further reading to help support learning and enquiry; and
      iv) multiple choice quiz questions to evaluate understanding at the end.
      Educational Resources for introductory sequence and structural bioinformatics are currently being developed by
      ELIXIR TeSS, ELIXIR-UK and the UK Structural Bioinformatics group (via the FunPDBe project).
    subscribe: >
      TeSS also provides a subscription feature to help users to stay informed about courses, workshops and
      conferences of interest to them. The service may be customised by selecting the relevant filters, and
      initiated via the subscribe button. Users may choose to receive email notifications about upcoming
      events, or have them automatically added to their preferred calendar application.
    subscription_manager: >
      The <a href='%{subscriptions_path}'>subscriptions manager</a> page may be used to change the frequency of, or to remove, subscriptions.
    widgets_and_api: >
      To access TeSS data, organisations may readily import information about relevant events and materials to their site using widgets,
      or may create custom feeds using our API.

    registering_resources_in: "Registering Resources in %{site_name}"
    resources: >
      <p>Training resources (events and materials) may be added to TeSS to reach bigger audiences, increase impact and
      bolster event attendance. Registering events and training materials makes them more findable in a variety ways
      to various user bases.</p>
    methods: >
      <p>There are two ways to register training materials or events for display in TeSS:
      <ol><li>Arrange for an <a href="#automatic">automatic registration</a> solution;</li>
      <li>Use our form to register them <a href="#manual">manually</a>.</li></ol></p>
    automatic: >
      TeSS features several options for automatically "harvesting" resources from external sources.
      This can be helpful if you are maintaining a large collection of events and materials that changes frequently.
    structured: >
      <p>To register resources in TeSS automatically, we need to be able to extract data from target
      sources reliably. To this end, it is helpful if the data is structured according to some kind of standard format.</p>
      <p>The following are examples of the kinds of structured data that TeSS can work with.</p>
      <p>If your website currently includes no structured data, and you’d like your resources added to TeSS, we recommend using
      <a href="http://bioschemas.org" target="_blank">Bioschemas</a> to structure your site.</p>
    schema: >
      <p><a href='https://schema.org', target='_blank'>Schema.org</a> is a project run by a consortium of search engines.
      Schema.org has created an extensive library of schemas that web-masters can use to explicitly
      mark-up their websites content in order to improve search engine visibility and interoperability.</p>
      </p><p><a target='_blank', href='https://bioschemas.org'>Bioschemas</a> is an initiative to supplement the work of
      schema.org to help improve the findability of online resources in the life sciences.</p>
      The two main activities of Bioschemas are:
      <ul>
      <li>Proposing new types and properties to Schema.org to allow for the description of life science resources.</li>
      <li>Defining usage profiles over the Schema.org types that identify the essential properties to use in describing a resource.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      TeSS supports the following Bioschemas profiles:<br/>
      <strong>for events that are courses</strong>
      <ul>
      <li><a target='_blank', href='https://bioschemas.org/profiles/CourseInstance/0.9-DRAFT'>CourseInstance</a></li>
      <li><a target='_blank', href='https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Course/0.10-DRAFT'>Course</a></li>
      </ul>
      <strong>for other events</strong>
      <ul>
      <li><a target='_blank', href='https://bioschemas.org/profiles/Event/0.2-DRAFT-2019_06_14'>Event</a></li>
      </ul>
      <strong>for training materials</strong>
      <ul>
      <li><a target='_blank', href='https://bioschemas.org/profiles/TrainingMaterial/1.0-RELEASE'>TrainingMaterial</a></li>
      </ul>
    sitemap: >
      <p>To help search engines (and TeSS) discover all the pages on a site that have Bioschemas markup, a
      <a target='_blank', href='https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/overview'>sitemap</a>
      should be used. Sitemaps are basically a directory listing of all the pages on your site.</p>

      <p>Sitemaps are a well-established standard, and there should be sitemap libraries and plugins available for
      whichever software you are using to provide your site.</p>
    api: >
      <p>Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, typically have endpoint URLs that, when accessed, return data in a
      common exchange format, such as JSON.</p>
      <p>TeSS currently supports the APIs for:
      <ul>
      <li><a target='_blank', href='https://eventbrite.com'>Eventbrite</a> - for events</li>
      <li><a target='_blank', href='https://zenodo.com'>Zenodo</a> - for materials</li>
      <li>Other TeSS instances - for events</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    calendar: >
      <p>Many organisations use calendar applications to organise and display their events.
      These may be custom-made or, more likely, utilise applications like Google Calendar. Calendar applications
      maintain an underlying file for event storage and retrieval, typically in the iCal (.ics) format.</p>
      <p>TeSS can extract event descriptions, dates and locations from iCal files.</p>
    other_types: >
      <ul><li><b>RSS Feed</b>: an RSS feed is a type of news format. Many websites have such feeds, which list recent
      posts in a standard format. We can write scripts to parse this format;</li>
      <li><b>Git Repository:</b> a git repository is a directory containing files that can be edited collaboratively.
      If you are using GitHub (or similar) to develop your training resources, and/or use GitHub Pages to render them,
      we can write a script that clones the repository and extracts resource information. We may ask you to create a
      metadata file in YAML format to help us extract the metadata;</li>
      <li><b>Other:</b> if you have training metadata in another structured format (e.g., an XML or JSON dump, a CSV
      file, a YAML file, or other format), it may be possible for the TeSS team to write a script to parse it.</li></ul>
    user_managed_sources: >
      <p>Owners and editors of content providers in TeSS can register and manage <em>Sources</em> to be automatically
      ingested. A source consists of a URL for TeSS to fetch, and an "ingestion method" - which hints to TeSS how the
      contents of the URL should be processed.</p>
      <p>Once registered, a source will need to be approved by an administrator before it is active, but can be tested
      to see exactly what metadata TeSS can extract from the source.</p>
      <p>To register a source, click the "Sources" tab on your content provider page, or if you have not yet registered
      a content provider, click the button below.</p>
    advice: >
      Contact <a href="mailto:%{contact_email}">%{contact_email}</a> to discuss how to register your content
      automatically in TeSS.
    manual: >
      <p>Resources may be added manually to TeSS.</p>
      <p>To do so, first register for a free account. Members of academic institutions may be able to log-in via LS-Login.</p>
      <p>Once registered and logged in, the 'register event' and 'register material' buttons will become visible on the
      events and materials tabs. Alternatively click here:</p>
